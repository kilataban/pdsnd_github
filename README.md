## Project Title
Udacity Python Bikeshare Data Project

## Description
The goal of this project was to carry out exploratory analysis of bikeshare data from 3 major American cities (New York City, Chicago, and Washington DC) in order to determine facts about the demographics.

This was done through prompts that gave this data:
* Most popular month
* Most popular day
* Most popular hour
* Most popular start station
* Most popular end station
* Most popular combination of start and end stations
* Total trip duration
* Average trip duration
* Types of users by number
* Types of users by gender (if available)
* The oldest user (if available)
* The youngest user (if available)
* The most common birth year amongst users (if available)

## How to run the program
### Requirements
*A computer running the latest version of Python 3
*Conda environment where Numpy and Pandas libraries can be accessed

### Files used
The following data files were provided by Udacity:
chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv and washington.csv

### Running the program
Download the program files as described. In a terminal or bash session in the same directory as bikeshare.py enter: _python bikeshare.py_ and respond to the prompts to get the data analysis.
